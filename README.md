### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

> I am a beginner to intermediate level coder looking to take the next step in development. I have been primarily focusing on python to learn coding fundamentals, and now that I have a good grasp on beginner concepts I have been branching out into more advanced topics. I have been working on developing my SQL and Python-Django database design and I hope to be able to development these concepts for uses in the engineering field.
